comment: Resistance is associated with short internode distance prior to V6. Resistance is correlated with sclerenchyma differentiation leading to a physical barrier to the larva. Reduction of pith cavity also contributes to resistance. Vigna radiata (mung bean), V. cylindrica(cowpea) and Phaseolus vulgaris(snap bean) also attacked.
